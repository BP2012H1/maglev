There is currently one patch in the mysql.rb:

    # GEMSTONE
    if defined? Maglev
      # The driver defines a finalizer, but MagLev does not yet support
      # finalization.  The default implentation raises a NotImplementedError.
      # We override that so we can run the driver.
      def ObjectSpace.define_finalizer(*args)
      end
    end
    # END GEMSTONE
