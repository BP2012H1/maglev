# There are a few tasks that can't be done using rake while running MagLev, such as
# starting or reloading MagLev itself: "rake maglev:start" or "rake status".
# One workaround is to use the "maglev" shell script: "maglev start" or "maglev status".
# However, if you are using RVM (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) this "rake-rvm" script
# can be used invoke the rake from Ruby 1.8.7.
#
# "rvm-rake maglev:start" or "rvm-rake status"
#
# It's an imperfect solution, but a usable hack for now.
