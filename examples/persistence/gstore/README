This is a demo of how you might implement the standard ruby PStore library
using MagLev persistence, rather than the filesystem and marshal.  See the
comments in gstore.rb for more details.

To run this example:

1: Ensure MagLev is running

2: Ensure the smalltalk ffi wrappers have been generated:

     $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
     $ rake dev:stwrappers

   This will populate $MAGLEV_HOME/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/smalltalk with
   the necessary files

3: Run the main.rb script:

     $ maglev-ruby main.rb

4: You can also run main.rb using MRI, or another ruby impleentation:

     $ ruby main.rb
