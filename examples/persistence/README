This directory contains demos using MagLev persistence.

The gstore directory is a demo of how you might implement the standard ruby
PStore library using MagLev persistence, rather than the filesystem and
marshal.  It is a proof of concept only.

kdtree contains a pure Ruby implementation of a KD Tree (a
multi-dimensional binary tree).  The demo shows how to search for the
nearest items to a given location.  The database of known locations (postal
codes, coffee shops, etc.) is stored persistently in a pure ruby data
structure within MagLev.
