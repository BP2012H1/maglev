= MagLev indexing example

== Overview

This example shows how to add an index onto an unordered collection of
data.  The index will allow fast search / retrieval of objects based on the
values of their attributes.

Most of the code in the lib directory is to generate somewhat interesting
random names, addresses and people.  The Person class is pretty simple, and
is just to provide fodder for indexing.
