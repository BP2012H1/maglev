= MagLev indexing example

== Overview

The main examples to study here is test/index_test.rb.  This example shows
how to add an index onto an unordered collection of data.  The index will
allow fast search / retrieval of objects based on the values of their
attributes.

Most of the code in the lib directory is to generate somewhat interesting
random names, addresses and people.  The Person class is pretty simple, and
is just to provide fodder for indexing.
