A simple blog with comments for experimentation.

The names of the classes, "Post" and "Comment", as well as the list of
attributes and their names, comes from the blog example from the Rails
2.2.2 getting_started_with_rails.txt file.  See the TODO.txt for hints of
rails features to add to this example.
