* Notes
** Features to implement
   + Should we add an ontology?  Give meaning to the tags (rdf)?
   + Update model to use ActiveModel validation checks
     (validate_presence_of :password, :username) etc.
   + Add
*** TODO Threading architecture for MagLev
    + Given we only want one txn going at a time, we need to grab a lock
      (in txn wrapper?).  But, we can allow many readers?

*** TODO Allow anyone to look at a user's tweets (user's home)
*** TODO Implement mentions queue for each user
*** TODO Add tagging features
*** TODO Create MRI/ORM version
*** TODO Add handling of '/'
*** Transaction Model

    Should we try running the vm in manual transaction mode, and then begin
    have the txn wrapper do:

      def call(env)
        Maglev.begin_transaction
        r = @app.call(env)
      ensure
        if committable?(r[0])
          Maglev.commit_transaction
        else
          Maglev.abort_transaction
        end
      end

    That way, we are not in a transaction unless we are handling an HTTP
    request.

    We would need to:
    + Expose System>>transactionMode:, System>>transactionMode and add a
      few constants.
    + Write wrapper methods in maglev module
    + Add the new manual_txn_wrapper class in site_ruby
    + Add a command line parameter to control initial txn mode.
** ActiveRecord

   Many of the efficiencies that the MySQL paper lists, won't be available
   for ActiveRecord, since ActiveRecord uses surrogate keys (id column)
   rather than, e.g.,:

      CREATE TABLE Tag2Post (
        tag_id ...
        post_id ...
        , PRIMARY KEY pk_Tag2Post (tag_id, post_id)
        , INDEX (post_id)
      ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
** Typical Ruby Web App Demands/Performance

   In the unsubstantiated rumors department:

   >  An example taken from a common action on one of my production apps:
   >
   >  View 11.4ms
   >  Controller 5.7ms
   >  ActiveRecord 25.9ms
   >
   >  That 25.9 ms could definitely be better spent serving other
   >  requests...

   And

   > The other thing to keep in mind is that at least 90 to 95% of the
   > Rails apps out there donâ€™t get more than a dozen requests/second (a
   > million requests/day). You can scale that kind of load pretty easily
   > using simple approaches

** Tests and results
   + Tests are run in production mode.  To do this
     1. pass "--env production" to rackup (prevents rack from adding
        extraneous middleware, like lint etc.)
     2. "set :environment, :production" in config.ru tells sinatra to only
        install necessary middleware.
     In general, we'll be running with: content_length and cookie
     middleware.
   + No debug output to tty
   + All test runs start off with a "GET /info" so we can document the ruby
     environment, date and the installed middleware.  Then we run the
     test.
   + TODO: Can we show the sinatra options?
   + TODO: Can we rely on front-end httpd logging instead of common logger?
   + TODO: Make sure all debug etc. are off for running the performance
     tests.


   It might be nice to see how much caching can reduce load on server
   (e.g., rails caching, Rack-cache, varnish etc.).

   Nice to compare performance of MRI + EventMachine vs MagLev +
   GreenThreads to see what the difference is.  The hypothesis is that the
   GemStone/S Green Thread is very much like EventMachine reactor. (but we
   still have the transaction limitation...).
   

*** TIME_WAIT problem
**** Description
     It became quickly apparent that I was running into a TIME_WAIT
     problem.  I'd get to around 8,000 requests, and then pause for about
     ten seconds (both mri and maglev).  Looking at netstat showed:

       $ netstat -finet -n | grep TIME_WAIT | wc
       16346   98076 1258642

     So, 16k sockets waiting, and system waiting before it passes out
     another socket...

     For every connection from +ab+, there are two sockets

     |---+----------+----------+----------+----------|
     | # | Client   | Protocol | Socket   | Server   |
     |---+----------+----------+----------+----------|
     | 1 | ab       | HTTP     | TCP:3333 | lighttpd |
     | 2 | lighttpd | SCGI     | TCP:3000 | Ruby     |
     |---+----------+----------+----------+----------|

**** Solutions?

     1: Use one socket? In the SCGI protocol, the server indicates the end
        of a response by closing the connection, so, there is not much hope
        of keeping one connection per SCGI server...
     2: Use Unix domain sockets (if on same machine)?  Can we configure
        lighttpd and SCGI module?

     3: Play with SO_LINGER ?

     Could go to FCGI, since it allows multiple requests per socket as an
     option.

*** Test 4: Locking vs Non-Locking transaction wrapper (no contention)
    This test attempts to characterize how much overhead is there in
    wrapping each HTTP request in a transaction AND grabbing a VM lock.
    The idea is that we want to ensure there is only one thread potentially
    modifying persistent data at a time.  This particular run shows only
    the overhead of getting the lock and releasing it, as it is a
    read-only, static file request.

    | Wrapper                 | Req/sec | Time/req (ms) |
    |-------------------------+---------+---------------|
    | Non-Locking txn wrapper |     848 |          11.8 |
    | Locking txn wrapper     |     803 |          12.4 |
    |-------------------------+---------+---------------|
    | Diff                    |      45 |          -0.6 |
    | %                       |      5% |            5% |

    There is a 5% overhead for grabbing and releasing a lock.

    Test run with lighttpd and SCGI

*** Test 3: Load static file with lighttpd + scgi + 1 maglev VM
    In this configuration, lighttpd is passing all requests (even for
    static files) to MagLev via SCGI.  There is one maglev VM running

    There is a problem at slightly over 8k requests (8192?) with both
    MagLev and MRI 1.8.7.  I sometimes get a long (~11 sec) delay and then
    it starts going again, or I get:

*** Test 2: Measure the overhead of a transaction per request
    This test was only done on Maglev, as it is the only one with built-in
    transactions.  The setup is similar to Test 1, but we are comparing no
    middleware to one that does a <tt>Maglev.abort_transaction</tt> at the
    beginning of each HTTP request, and does a
    <tt>Maglev.commit_transaction</tt> at the end of each successful HTTP
    request.  This is done via rack middleware:

      class TransactionWrapper
        def initialize(app)
          @app = app
        end

        def call(env)
          begin
            Maglev.abort_transaction
            r = @app.call env
          ensure
            Maglev.commit_transaction if committable? r[0]
          end
        end

        def committable?(status)
          ! status.nil? &&  (200..399).include?(status)
        end
      end

      | Without transactions | 547.64 | 18.260 |
      | With transactions    | 494.56 | 20.220 |
      | Difference           |  53.08 |  -1.96 |

      Looks like transaction overhead (with no data to commit!) take about
      2ms, or about 11% penalty over no transactions.

*** Test 1: Measure overhead of a rack middleware
    Install an empty Rack middleware app that does nothing.  The intent is
    to distinguish the overhead of the transaction processing vs the rack
    overhead when using the transaction wrapper middleware.

    + The file we loaded was the following 22 characters: /* Empty MagTag.css */

**** Results

     Basically, the overhead of the following rack app is "negligible"
     (less than a quarter of a millisecond, or around 0.5% of an average
     request).

       class EmptyMiddleware
         def initialize(app)
           @app = app
         end

         def call(env)
           @app.call env
         end

     The MagLev run with the middleware was actually faster than without
     the middleware (by about 2.5%, or so).  Let's assume that is in the
     noise.  It is .8ms faster with the middleware

     1.9.2 is slower!!?? than 1.8.7 ?
