* Notes 
** TODO
   + Should we add an ontology?  Give meaning to the tags (rdf)?
   + Update model to use ActiveModel validation checks
     (validate_presence_of :password, :username) etc.
** ActiveRecord

   Many of the efficiencies that the MySQL paper lists, won't be available
   for ActiveRecord, since ActiveRecord uses surrogate keys (id column)
   rather than, e.g.,:

      CREATE TABLE Tag2Post (
        tag_id ...
        post_id ...
        , PRIMARY KEY pk_Tag2Post (tag_id, post_id)
        , INDEX (post_id)
      ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
