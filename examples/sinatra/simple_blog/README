== Simple Sinatra Blog App for MagLev

This is a very simple blog app that uses Maglev persistence.

=== Files

* README  This file
* blog.rb  The persistent, business classes for the app.  This code is run
  once only.
* blog_app.rb The Sinatra app
* dumpdb.rb  Script that prints the contents of the db to stdout (debugging)
* txn_wrapper.rb  Rack middleware used by <tt>blog_app.rb</tt> to wrap a
  transaction around each HTTP request.

=== To Run

The app is split into a persistent part, <tt>blog.rb</tt>, and the sinatra
driver app, <tt>blog_app.rb</tt>.  You need to load <tt>blog.rb</tt> once,
which will define and persist the classes needed for the app, and then run
<tt>blog_app.rb</tt> to fire up Sinatra:

  $ maglev-ruby blog.rb  # only needs to be done once for a repository

  $ maglev-ruby blog     # run everytime you want to start the app

Then hit http://localhost:4567/

=== Issues

* Need better separation of model helpers and business objects.  Some of
  the lightweight Ruby ORM solutions (DataMapper, Sequel) provide nice
  features needed by any app.  We need some help here.

=== TODO

TODO for the sinatra app

* Get persistence of sinatra and rack working (autoload persistence)
* Get a template engine working
* Try using shotgun for dev time file reloading (or Rack::Reloader)
* Get sessions working
