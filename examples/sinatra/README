== MagLev Sinatra Examples

The files in this directory are some examples of using Sinatra with MagLev.

=== <tt>sinatratest.rb</tt>: Run Sinatra w/o RubyGems

A simple app that runs from the 0.9.3 version of Sinatra under
<tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/src/external/sinatra</tt>.  To run:

    $ maglev-ruby sinatratest.rb

Then hit http://localhost:4567/

=== <tt>sinatra_app.rb</tt>: Run Sinatra from RubyGems

A Sinatra app that runs from a version of Sinatra installed by rubygems.
To run this version:

1. Install rubygems-1.3.5 into MagLev by following the directions in
   <tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/docs/applications</tt>.
2. Install the rack and sinatra gems:
    $ maglev-gem install rack sinatra
3. Run the file, then hit http://localhost:4567/
    $ maglev-ruby ./sinatra_app.rb

The file <tt>sinatra_app.rb</tt> explicitly invokes the Sinatra application
as a work-around.  Sinatra tries to figure out whether to automatically
start the application by examining the backtrace from
<tt>Kernel#caller</tt>, and comparing it to <tt>$0</tt> (see
<tt>sinatra/lib/main.rb</tt>).  MagLev currently has full pathnames for the
filename in the backtrace, but MRI uses the file name "as found on
<tt>$LOADED_FEATURES</tt>".  Since there is a mismatch, Sinatra doesn't
automatically start the app.

A workaround is to patch
<tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/lib/maglev/gems/1.8.6/gems/sinatra-0.9.4/lib/sinatra/main.rb</tt>,
and change:
    set :run, Proc.new { $0 == app_file }
to:
    set :run, Proc.new { File.basename($0) == File.basename(app_file) }
