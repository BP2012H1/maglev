== MagLev Sinatra Examples

The files in this directory are some examples of using Sinatra with MagLev.
You must first install the sinatra gem:

  $ maglev-gem install sinatra

=== <tt>sinatratest.rb</tt>: App to test basic Sinatra Features

This app has several links that test various features of Sinatra.  To run:

    $ cd <tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/examples/sinatra/tt>.
    $ maglev-ruby sinatratest.rb

Then hit http://localhost:4567/

=== <tt>sinatra_app.rb</tt>: Run Sinatra from RubyGems

Another simple app.  This one also has a test case using MiniTest and
Rack::Test (based on http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html).


To Run the test case, you'll need the sinatra, rack and minitest gems
installed into MagLev, then:

    $ maglev-ruby sinatra_app_test.rb
    Loaded suite sinatra_app_test
    Started
    .
    Finished in 0.122495 seconds.

    1 tests, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

=== <tt>msessions.rb</tt>: App with MagLev persistence for sessions

This app uses rack Middleware to install a MagLev Rack::Session backing
store for MagLev.  When run, the session data is persisted to MagLev
(rather than memcached etc.).
