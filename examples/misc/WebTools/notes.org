* Notes on the re-tool of WebTools

** Things to change:

   1. The /tools url returns objects.  The 'file' attribute is really a uri
      attribute.  The ST WebTools expected something like CodeBrowser.html,
      and would serve up that file.  In Sinatra, I use a simple URI like
      '/browser', and let the view return the guts....  Thus the name
      'file' is a misnonmer.

** How the tabs work

   The tabs use jQuery http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
