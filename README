== Quick Start

You run MagLev using the +maglev+ script in the <tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/bin</tt>
directory.  For best results, set +MAGLEV_HOME+, and add
<tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/bin</tt> to your <tt>PATH</tt>.  You must run <tt>maglev
start</tt> before running commands that execute ruby code.

The two scripts <tt>maglev-irb</tt> and <tt>maglev-ruby</tt> are provded
for convenience, but at this time, they simply duplicate the function of
<tt>maglev irb</tt> and <tt>maglev ruby</tt> and allow several options.

=== <tt>maglev-irb</tt>: Open an interactive maglev shell
  Usage: maglev-irb [options]
  OPTIONS:
     -d      Run in debugging mode
     -h      Show help message
     -v      Print version number

=== <tt>maglev-ruby</tt>: Execute a Ruby file
  Usage: maglev-ruby [options] <filename>
  OPTIONS:
     -d      Run in debugging mode
     -h      Show help message
     -v      Print version number

=== <tt>maglev</tt>:  Control the MagLev system
  Usage: maglev {start|start-debug|stop|restart|status|ruby|irb|topaz|
                 topaz-debug|squeak|preload|force-reload|version|help}

  To control the MagLev server:
  maglev start          - Start MagLev server processes
  maglev start-debug    - Start MagLev server processes with verbose output
  maglev start-parser   - Force parser process to start if it's dead
  maglev stop           - Stop MagLev server processes
  maglev restart        - Restart MagLev server processes
  maglev status         - Display MagLev server status
  maglev version        - Display MagLev version number
  maglev preload <file> - Load and commit a file into an already running system
  maglev force-reload   - Stop MagLev server, replace with empty repository!!!

  To execute other maglev commands:
  maglev irb            - Enter a MagLev interactive shell (same as maglev-irb)
  maglev ruby  <file>   - Execute a Ruby file (same as maglev-ruby)
  maglev topaz          - Enter a Topaz shell
  maglev topaz-debug    - Enter a Topaz shell useful for debugging
  maglev squeak         - Start optional Squeak development environment
  maglev vsd            - Start Visual Statistics Display monitoring tool
  maglev help           - Display this text

=== Note:
* set <tt>MAGLEV_HOME</tt> to the full path of this directory, and add
  <tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/bin</tt> to your <tt>PATH</tt>. Then you can use
  <tt>maglev ruby</tt> etc from anywhere.
* if you have multiple installations, set <tt>PARSETREE_PORT</tt> to
  control which port the parser server listens on
* the first (and ony the first) time you run a maglev command that runs
  Ruby code, it will load and compile its primitives, which takes up to a
  minute to run.
* <tt>maglev-ruby</tt> prints a topaz banner every time it is
  run. <tt>maglev-irb</tt> does not, but it will make errors more difficult
  to debug, as they won't return to Topaz.

=== Ruby code:
* <tt>src/</tt> and <tt>src/lib/</tt> are both on the require path
* <tt>src/kernel/</tt> has the core +Array+, +String+ etc. files
