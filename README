Quick Start:

You can run everything in MagLev using the 'gemstone' bash script in the bin subdirectory.
For best results, set MAGLEV_HOME, and add $MAGLEV_HOME/bin to your PATH

Usage:
gemstone {start|start-debug|stop|restart|status|topaz|ruby|squeak|preload|force-reload|help}

First, control the GemStone server from one terminal session:
gemstone start          - Start GemStone server processes
gemstone start-debug    - Start GemStone server processes with verbose output
gemstone start-parser   - Force parser process to start if it's dead
gemstone stop           - Stop GemStone server processes
gemstone restart        - Restart GemStone server processes
gemstone status         - Display GemStone server status
gemstone preload <file> - Load and commit a file into an already running system
gemstone force-reload   - Stop GemStone server, overwrite with empty repository!!!

Next, in a second terminal session, run other gemstone commands:
gemstone ruby  <file>   - Execute a Ruby file
gemstone topaz          - Enter a Topaz shell
gemstone topaz-debug    - Enter a Topaz shell useful for debugging 
gemstone squeak         - Start optional Squeak development environment
gemstone help           - Display this text

Note:
- set MAGLEV_HOME to the full path of this directory, and add $MAGLEV_HOME/bin to your PATH. 
    Then you can use "gemstone ruby" etc from anywhere.
- if you have multiple installations, set PARSETREE_PORT to control 
    which port the parser server listens on
- the first (and ony the first) time you run a gemstone command that runs Ruby code, 
    it will load and compile prims.rb, which takes up to a minute to run.
- gemstone ruby prints a topaz banner every time it is run. This will be fixed in a
    future release. If you run "gemstone topaz" and then "maglev" you'll be in an irb-like
    environment, and you won't get a banner on every command.
 
Ruby code:
- src/ and src/lib/ are both on the require path
- src/kernel/ has the core Array, String etc files
