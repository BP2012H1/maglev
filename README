Quick Start:

You run MagLev using the 'maglev' script in the $MAGLEV_HOME/bin directory.
For best results, set MAGLEV_HOME, and add $MAGLEV_HOME/bin to your PATH.
You must run 'maglev start' before running commands that execute ruby code.

The two scripts 'maglev-irb' and 'maglev-ruby' are provded for convenience,
but at this time, they simply duplicate the function of 'maglev irb' and
maglev ruby' and allow several options.

maglev-irb: Open a maglev shell
Usage: maglev-irb [options]
OPTIONS:
   -d      Run in debugging mode
   -h      Show help message
   -v      Print version number

maglev-ruby: Execute a Ruby file
Usage: maglev-ruby [options] <filename>
OPTIONS:
   -d      Run in debugging mode
   -h      Show help message
   -v      Print version number

maglev:  Control the MagLev system
Usage: maglev {start|start-debug|stop|restart|status|ruby|irb|topaz|topaz-debug|
               squeak|preload|force-reload|version|help}

To control the MagLev server:
maglev start          - Start MagLev server processes
maglev start-debug    - Start MagLev server processes with verbose output
maglev start-parser   - Force parser process to start if it's dead
maglev stop           - Stop MagLev server processes
maglev restart        - Restart MagLev server processes
maglev status         - Display MagLev server status
maglev version        - Display MagLev version number
maglev preload <file> - Load and commit a file into an already running system
maglev force-reload   - Stop MagLev server, replace with empty repository!!!

To execute other maglev commands:
maglev irb            - Enter a MagLev interactive shell (same as maglev-irb)
maglev ruby  <file>   - Execute a Ruby file (same as maglev-ruby)
maglev topaz          - Enter a Topaz shell
maglev topaz-debug    - Enter a Topaz shell useful for debugging 
maglev squeak         - Start optional Squeak development environment
maglev vsd            - Start Visual Statistics Display monitoring tool
maglev help           - Display this text

Note:
- set MAGLEV_HOME to the full path of this directory, 
      and add $MAGLEV_HOME/bin to your PATH. 
      Then you can use "maglev ruby" etc from anywhere.
- if you have multiple installations, set PARSETREE_PORT to control 
      which port the parser server listens on
- the first (and ony the first) time you run a maglev command
      that runs Ruby code, it will load and compile its primitives,
      which takes up to a minute to run.
- maglev-ruby prints a topaz banner every time it is run. 
      maglev-irb does not, but it will make errors more difficult to debug,
      as they won't return to Topaz.
 
Ruby code:
- src/ and src/lib/ are both on the require path
- src/kernel/ has the core Array, String etc files
