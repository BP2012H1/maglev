== These are notes on the MagLev Alpha release.

=== Running MagLev

Run maglev with <tt>bin/maglev-ruby</tt>. 

=== Transaction support

The Gemstone class has methods for +commitTransaction+, +abortTransaction+
and +beginTransaction+.

=== <tt>maglev-irb</tt>

The first rule of <tt>maglev-irb</tt> is that you don't talk about +irb+,
because <tt>maglev-irb</tt> is not +irb+.  Eventually, <tt>maglev-irb</tt>
will be +irb+, but not yet.

<tt>maglev-irb</tt> has a few commands to help using it:
* +STOP+ (recover from parse error)
* transaction control commands: +BEGIN+, +ABORT+, +COMMIT+

=== Errata
==== Kernel
* <tt>Kernel#autoload</tt> is a stub.  It does an immediate require of the
  file. 
* <tt>Kernel#autoload?</tt> is a stub.  It always returns nil.
* <tt>Kernel#require</tt>: Tilde expansion is done only on <tt>~/...</tt>,
  not on <tt>~user/...</tt>, <tt>$"</tt> is not updated

==== Threads
* <tt>ThreadGroup</tt> is a stub.

==== Misc
* +ARGF+ is not supported
* +ObjectSpace+: Not supported
* <tt>Object.equal?</tt> may not be overridden.  For performance reasons,
  it is a special selector.
