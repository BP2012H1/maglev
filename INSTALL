If you are reading this file, you must have successfully unzipped MagLev,
but there are some prerequisites for it to run correctly.

You must have MRI 1.8.6 installed. Other versions are not supported.
You must have the ParseTree gem installed, if it is not:
	gem install ParseTree
if you are asked, pick 2.2.0

If 'gemstone status' tells you "MagLev Parse Server is not running on port 2001"
it is most likely a problem running the ParseTree gem. To diagnose:
	export PARSETREE_PORT=2001
	cd $MAGLEV_HOME/bin
	ruby parsetree_parser.rb
If that gives the following error on MacOSX:
	ERROR: Canâ€™t find header dir for ruby
you can resolve the problem by upgrading to the latest Xcode
	http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html

'gemstone status' uses the lsof command to see if the parse server
is running. If you do not have lsof installed, or cannot run it,
uncomment the equivalent netstat command in $MAGLEV_HOME/bin/gemstone.
