PLEASE READ THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING

In addition to proprietary code owned by VMware, GemStone/S software
products (the "GemStone Products") include computer code licensed
under various open source licenses ("open source software" or "OSS").
The text of each of those licenses is available in the files in this
directory listed below.

Nothing in VMware's End User License Agreement or any other document
to which VMware is a party or by which it is bound overrides the terms
of the relevant open source licenses with respect to the OSS covered by
that license or requires either party to take any action that conflicts
with that OSS license.

However, if an OSS license permits a licensee to modify any of the
GemStone Products and a licensee elects to exercise that right, that
modification will terminate VMware's warranty, and any maintenance
and support obligations, for that GemStone Product.

Although these licenses are included in the appropriate files throughout
the distribution, we've copied them to this centralized location for
easier reference.

Ruby source code written by VMware is licensed under the
MIT license:

written by VMware are governed by:

non-GPL license.
