Many thanks to the MagLev Alpha testers who have contributed code and design ideas,
reported and sometimes fixed bugs, and helped in many other ways, including:.

- Markus Roberts, for lots of feedback, bugfixes, and porting zaml to MagLev.
- Danie Roux and Otto Behrens, for providing rake scripts to manage multiple
  MagLev systems on a single computer.
- Michael Latta, for valuable feedback while suffering through earliest Alphas.
- Avi Bryant, for a lot of inspiration and hard work from day one.
