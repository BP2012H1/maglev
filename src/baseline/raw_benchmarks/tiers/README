To run a set of benchmarks against every rvm installed ruby, then
generate web pages and a comparison spreadsheet of the results:
  
  nohup ./benchmark_rvm_rubies.sh all &

The Rakefile parses the run.yaml files produced by the compare script
and generates a .csv file or web page containing normalized geometric means.

  rake to_csv  # Generate a CSV file of benchmark results
  rake to_web  # Generate a web page with at graph of benchmark results


Rakefile ENV variable usage and examples:

BASELINE    Which ruby to use as the basis for normalization
YAML_DIR    Root of tree containing .yaml files to analyze
NORMALIZE   Use time (lower numbers better) or speed (higher numbers better)
OUTPUT_DIR  Directory where the spreadsheet will be written

The default Ruby to use as a baseline for comparison is ruby-1.8.6-p383. To
generate a comparison agains another Ruby:
  rake BASELINE=ruby-1.8.7-p248

The default YAML_DIR is the current directory. To narrow the results:
  rake YAML_DIR=runs/2010-01-04

The default is to compare normalized times (i.e. lower numbers are better)
To use speed instead:
  rake NORMALIZE=speed

The default OUTPUT_DIR is ./results. To put results elsewhere:
  rake OUTPUT_DIR=~/benchmark_performance

The default output filename includes the operating system and hostname followed
by an underscore. i.e. "Linux-aries_" You can change it:
  rake IDENT="Ubuntu_"
  rake IDENT=""

Note: all runs to be compared in the spreadsheet should be against the same rubies.
Otherwise, the overall Geometric Mean can not be computed.

TODO: parameterize number of iterations, etc.
