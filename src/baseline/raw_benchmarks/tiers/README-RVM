Wayne Seguin provided a shell script to run Evan Phoenix's "tiers"
benchmarks on all Rubies installed with RVM. See benchmark_rvm_rubies.sh
for details.

I modified Evan's compare.rb so it would pick up the names of the
RVM installed Rubies from the rvm directories. Otherwise they would
all have just been called "ruby". Since it was using median
values, I removed the warmup. It's not significant and it could
be useful to see that information.

I wrote a Rakefile to generate a .csv spreadsheet that parses the
run.yaml files produced by Wayne's script and generates a spreadsheet
containing normalized geometric means. 

To run the generic tests and generate a comparison spreadsheet:

  nohup ./benchmark_rvm_rubies.sh all &

Note: This directory is self contained. Running the benchmarks can create
lots of files, so you may not want to run it inside your git repo.



Rakefile ENV variable usage and examples:

BASELINE    Which ruby to use as the basis for normalization
YAML_DIR    Root of tree containing .yaml files to analyze
NORMALIZE   Use time (lower numbers better) or speed (higher numbers better)
OUTPUT_DIR  Directory where the spreadsheet will be written

The default Ruby to use as a baseline for comparison is ruby-1.8.6-p383. To
generate a comparison agains another Ruby:
  rake BASELINE=ruby-1.8.7-p248

The default YAML_DIR is the current directory. To narrow the results:
  rake YAML_DIR=runs/2010-01-23

The default is to compare normalized times (i.e. lower numbers are better)
To use speed instead:
  rake NORMALIZE=speed

The default OUTPUT_DIR is ./results. To put results elsewhere:
  rake OUTPUT_DIR=~/benchmark_performance



Note: all runs to be compared in the spreadsheet should be against the same rubies.
Otherwise, the overall Geometric Mean can not be computed.
