Wayne Seguin provided a shell script to run Evan Phoenix's tiers
benchmarks on all Rubies installed with RVM. See benchmark_rvm_rubies.sh
for details.

I modified Evan's compare.rb so it would pick up the names of the RVM installed
Rubies from the rvm directories. Otherwise they would all have just been called "ruby".

I wrote a Rakefile to generate a .csv spreadsheet that parses the run.yaml files
produced by Wayne and generates a spreadsheet containing normalized geometric means.

To run the generic tests I suggest: 

nohup benchmark_rvm_rubies.sh all &

The default baseline is ruby-1.8.6-p383. To generate a comparison agains another impl,
run the Rakefile against another BASELINE as follows:
rake YAML_DIR=runs/2010-01-23 BASELINE=ruby-1.8.7-p248

If you don't specify a YAML_DIR, it will find all of them.
