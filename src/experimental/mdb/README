= MaglevDB (MDB)

This directory contains some experimental code to wrap MagLev as a Nosql
Server (MagLevDB, AKA MDB).

The MaglevDB code is in the +mdb+ directory, and a sample Sinatra
application that connects to MaglevDB is in the +app+ directory.

== Quick Start:

Install prerequisites and load MDB server:

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME/src/experimental/mdb
    $ rake setup

Run MDB server:

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME/src/experimental/mdb/mdb
    $ rake server:start  # Starts server...^C to stop it

Setup client app, in a new shell:

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME/src/experimental/mdb/app
    $ rake app:run    # Runs migrations, then starts client app...^C to stop it

Hit http://localhost:3333/

At this point, the client application is running on port 3333, and the
MaglevDB server is running on port 4567.

== Details

=== Prerequisites

1. MagLev must be installed and the <tt>$MAGLEV_HOME</tt> environment
   variable must be correctly set.

2> To install the required RubyGems and load the MDB server, do:

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME/src/experimental/mdb
    $ rake setup

The +setup+ Rake task will ensure the following RubyGems are installed into
your MagLev distribution:

1. Rack
2. Sinatra

It will then load commit the MaglevDB server code into the MagLev
repository.

  NOT DONE YET

== TODO / Bugs

* commit code doesn't report errors.  E.g., I changed a model class from:
      class Tag < Array ... end
  to
      class Tag ... end
  And i did not get any indication that the migration failed, due to "wrong
  superclass".

* Need a migration strategy.  E.g., if you change your class (rather than
  just adding methods), how do you migrate your old, saved instances?
