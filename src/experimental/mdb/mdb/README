= MDB: MagLev Data Base

MDB is a document oriented / object oriented database implemented on the
MagLev VM and object repository.  Documents are stored in MDB as Plain Old
Ruby Objects and queries / views are implemented as plain old ruby
methods.

== Features

* Documents are plain old ruby objects
* Views are defined in Ruby, and can be optionally reduced to JSON for
  transmission to a web application.
* REST api for communicating with the DB (similar to CouchDB)
* Databases may be indexed on attributes of the documents held in the
  database.
