= Sample MDB Client Application

This directory contains a simple Sinatra Blog application written to use
MagLevDB as the backend database.

== Running

To run the application:

1. Make sure the following rubygems have been installed into whichever ruby
   you are using:
   * Sinatra
   * Rack
   * Json

2. Make sure that your $PATH has the correct version of rackup in it (e.g.,
   if you want to run the client app using MRI, then make sure $PATH
   resolves "rackup" to the MRI RubyGem installed rackup).


3. $ rake app:run

Then hit http://localhost:3333/
