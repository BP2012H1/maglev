This directory holds test scripts useful for MagLev.

===================================================

1) Scripts to run ruby-benchmark-suite tests
  run_benchmarks-MagLev.rb  
  run_benchmarks-MRI.rb

The above scripts invoke other ruby scripts in ../benchmark/cangiano that are versions
of the bm_*.rb files from Antonio Cangiano's ruby-benchmark-suite which have
been modified to produce timing and status information as shown below:

==> Start benchmark: ./core-features/bm_app_answer.rb
             user     system      total        real
(any text output by the unmodified benchmark would be here)
         2.030000   0.260000   2.290000 (  2.316928)
==> End benchmark: ./core-features/bm_app_answer.rb

Suggested usage:
  nohup ruby ./run_benchmarks-MRI.rb 1>benchmark_results-MRI-${HOSTNAME}-`date +%y%m%d`.out 2>&1 &

  nohup maglev ruby ./run_benchmarks-MagLev.rb 1>benchmark_results-Maglev-${HOSTNAME}-`date +%y%m%d`.out 2>&1 &

You can run these without redirecting output if you want to watch a live run.

NOTE: At present the benchmarks require the following files to be in the directory
from which the scripts are run. These are links to the ../benchmarks hierarchy.
  fasta.input
  hilbert.rb
  random.input
  wc.input
  wc.input.base

2) Scripts to process results
  extractTimes.awk

The above script extracts benchmark names and timing information in spreadsheet format.
awk -f extractTimes.awk <benchmark-output-file>
