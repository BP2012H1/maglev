This directory contains tests for the MagLev persistence API.

The easiest way to run these tests is from rake:

  $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
  $ rake dev:p-tests

The rake task creates a new stone, then it runs each of the following
files in a fresh VM, and then destorys the test stone:

  persistence_tests.rb    # Define tests in VM 1
  run_tests.rb            # run all of the test_* methods in VM 2
  run_checks.rb           # run all of the check_* methods in VM 3

persistence_tests.rb
  This file defines the test cases.  Each test case is split into two
  methods:

     def test_001
       ...
     end

     def check_001
       ...
     end

  The test_* methods will all be run, in order by run_tests.rb.  The test_*
  methods typically write or delete objects from the persistent store,
  which will later be checked from a different VM when run_checks.rb runs.

  The check_* methods check the outcome of the corresponding test_* method,
  but in a new VM.

run_tests.rb
  Run all of the test_* methods defined in persistence_tests.rb

run_checks.rb
  Run all of the check_* methods defined in persistence_tests.rb

Since it is illegal to do certain operations from within a method
definition, many of the test_* methods simply require a file that does all
of the class definitions etc.  These files are named t*.rb.
