* Make GStore work, per persistence-api
* Check that Class.persistable=(true/false) works
* Check Class#maglev_persistable= and Class#maglev_persistable?
* Committing objects of non-persistable classes raises an exception
* Write test cases for all of the use case examples in the persistance-api
  doc.
* Should removing a method from a persistent class in transient mode raise
  an exception (the current behavior)?


* Call Maglev.persistent(persistable_instances=false) do ... end
* Tests with both transient and persistent classes getting defined and
  committed in lots of interleavings
