This directory contains source from outside the Ruby Libs that we don't
intend to ship with the product, but we feel is important that everyone
shares the same copy of.

rack-0.9.0
  Rack provides an minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and
  Ruby frameworks. 0.9.0. released on 2009-01-06.
  See: http://rack.rubyforge.org/
  License: MIT

  NOTE: Rack is based on autoload, which is currently a stub.  As soon as
  autoload is working, most of the dependency problems will go away (e.g.,
  not *all* Rack apps will depend on digest/md5 or scgi etc.).

  MagLev does not currently support the following Rack features:
  * openid
  * mongrel
  * memcache
  * thin
  * showexceptions (depends on erb)
  * showstatus (depends on erb)
  * cookies (depends on openssl)
  * fastcgi

  Rack library dependencies (selected):
    require 'digest/md5'
    require 'lsapi'
    require 'scgi'
    require 'set'
    require 'stringio'
    require 'tempfile'
    require 'thread'
    require 'time'
    require 'uri'
