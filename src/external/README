This directory contains source from outside the Ruby Libs that we don't
intend to ship with the product, but we feel is important that anyone
working with these apps on MagLev should share the same code/fixes.

Rack
  Rack provides an minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and
  Ruby frameworks. 0.9.1. released on 2009-01-10.
  See: http://rack.rubyforge.org/
  License: MIT

  MagLev does not currently support (at least) the following Rack features:
  * openid
  * mongrel
  * memcache
  * thin
  * showexceptions (depends on erb)
  * showstatus (depends on erb)
  * cookies (depends on openssl)
  * fastcgi

Sinatra
  Sinatra is a light-weight web framework for ruby.
  Version 0.9.0.4 (compatible with rack 0.9.1)
  License: MIT

  !!! NOTE !!!: Gemstone has made the following changes to the Sinatra code:
  * lib/sinatra/main.rb: Stubbed out the definition of run.  The
    implementation depended on examining the stack frames returnd by
    Kernel#caller, but the details of filenames caused problems (MagLev
    prints only full pathnames, while MRI prints a variety of formats).
  * lib/sinatra/base.rb: https://magtrac.gemstone.com/ticket/375
    MagLev wasn't passing the implicit block in a super call, so added
    an explicit &block parameter.
  * lib/sinatra/base.rb: https://magtrac.gemstone.com/ticket/376
    Work around problem between blocks vs. procs.

benchmark
  Antonio Cangiano's set of ruby benchmarks, and some scripts to run them.

racktest.rb
  A simple webrick test of Rack.  Run it, then hit http://localhost:3333/ .

      $ maglev-ruby racktest.rb

Ramaze
  A Ruby modular web framework. http://ramaze.net/

  !!! NOTE !!!: Gemstone has made the following changes to the Ramaze code:
  * lib/ramaze/reloader.rb: Commented out the test for RInotify gem, and
    force use of File.stat.  MagLev does not currently support rubygem.
  * Thread.abort_on_exception= is a stub, so...watch out.


ramaze_hello.rb
  An in-progress test script to run a simple ramaze app.

rubygems-1.3.1
  Ruby gems 1.3.1.  We're working on getting it to run.

  !!! NOTE !!!: Gemstone has made the following changes to the code:
  * rubygems-1.3.1/lib/rubygems/source_index.rb: Work around Trac 370

rxtest
  Tim Bray's rx code.  Rx is an automaton based XML tokenizer.  It was
  proposed as one of the real-world-ish applications to add to Antonio's
  benchmark suite.

sintatratest.rb
  NOT WORKING YET...this will be a simple sinatra smoke test, but it isn't
  working yet...
