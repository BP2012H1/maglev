# Class Maglev::System is identically Smalltalk System
#
# == Persistent Shared Counters
#
# Maglev::System maintins a set of persistent shared counters.
#
# Persistent shared counters provide a means for multiple sessions to share
# common integer values.  There are 128 persistent shared counters,
# numbered from 1 to 128. The index of the first counter is 1.
#
# Each update to a persistent shared counter causes a roundtrip to the
# stone process.  However reading the value of a counter is handled by the
# gem (and its page server, if any) and does not cause a roundtrip to the
# stone.
#
# Persistent shared counters are globally visible to all sessions on all
# shared page caches.
#
# Persistent shared counters hold 64 bit values and may be set to any
# signed 64 bit integer value.  No limit checks are done when incrementing
# or decrementing a counter.  Attempts to increment/decrement the counter
# above/below the minimum/maximum value of a signed 64-bit integer will
# cause the counter to 'roll over'.
#
# Persistent shared counters are independent of database transactions.
# Updates to counters are visible immediately and aborts have no effect on
# them.
#
# The values of all persistent shared counters are written to the primary
# database extent at checkpoint time.  Updates between checkpoints are
# written to the transaction log by the stone.  Therefore the state of the
# persistent shared counters is recoverable after a crash, restore from
# backup, and restore from transaction logs.
#
# Persistent shared counter performance is affected by the stone
# configuration option STN_COMMITS_ASYNC.  Setting this option to TRUE will
# result in faster update performance because the stone will respond to
# update requests after the tranlog write has been queued but before it
# completes.  Operating in this mode leaves a small chance of losing data
# should the stone or host machine crash after the tranlog write was queued
# but before it completes.  If this value is set to FALSE, the stone will
# only respond to update requests after the tranlog write has completed."

    # Attempts to update the persistent state of the Repository to include
    # changes made by this transaction.
    #
    # If the commit operation succeeds, then this method returns +true+,
    # and the current transaction's changes, if any, become a part of the
    # persistent Repository.  After the repository update, the session
    # exits the current transaction.  If the transaction mode is
    # <tt>:autoBegin</tt>, then the session enters a new transaction.  If
    # the transaction mode is <tt>:manualBegin</tt>, then the session
    # remains outside of a transaction.
    #
    # If conflicts prevent the repository update, then this method returns
    # +false+.  Call the <tt>transactionConflicts</tt> (TBD: not
    # implemented in ruby yet) method to determine the nature of the
    # conflicts.  If the session is outside of a transaction, then this
    # method raises the error <tt>#rtErrPrimOutsideTrans</tt>.
    #
    # This method also updates the session's view of GemStone.  If the
    # commit operation succeeds, then all objects in the session's view are
    # consistent with the current state of GemStone.  If the commit fails,
    # then this method retains all the changes that were made to objects
    # within the current transaction.  However, commits made by other
    # sessions are visible to the extent that changes in this transaction
    # do not conflict with them.

    # there was a failure.
