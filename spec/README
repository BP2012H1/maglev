This directory contains all of the spec related files.

do_not_run_specs
  A file read by default.mspec and Don's test files that list the specs
  under rubyspec that have a syntax error or otherwise blow up bad enough
  that we do not even attempt to run them.  Most of these should have a
  counterpart in localspec that has the offending bits removed.

localspec
  A directory that holds the Gemstone fixes for rubyspecs that cause MagLev
  to choke.
  NOTE: to get specs to run from this directory, you need to change the
  require and load statements in the files

  FROM:
      require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../spec_helper'
  TO:
      require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../rubyspec/language/' + '/../spec_helper'

mspec
  A git submodule that tracks the mspec framework.
  As of 2009-06-28, this is at version 1.5.12 of mspec.
  git://github.com/rubyspec/mspec

rubyspec
  A git submodule that tracks the rubyspecs.
  As of 2009-06-28, this was the HEAD from the rubyspec git repository.
  git://github.com/rubyspec/rubyspec

  In order to work around parser problems that cannot be resolved by tagging, 
  we've temporarily removed or altered the following files:

    rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/fiber/resume_spec.rb
    rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/fiber/transfer_spec.rb
    rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/kernel/__callee__spec.rb
    rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/kernel/__method__spec.rb

    cp spec/localspec/core/module/autoload_spec.rb \
       spec/rubyspec/core/module/autoload_spec.rb
    cp spec/localspec/language/super_spec.rb \
       spec/rubyspec/language/super_spec.rb

tags
  The Gemstone rubyspec tags.  These are maintained in the git repository.
  To get a complete run of passing specs using tags:
  cd $MAGLEV_HOME
  spec/mspec/bin/mspec -G fails -G breaks -G crashes -G hangs \
    spec/rubyspec/language/ spec/rubyspec/core spec/rubyspec/library/stringio/
