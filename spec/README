This directory contains all of the spec related files.

do_not_run_specs
  A file read by default.mspec and Don's test files that list the specs
  under rubyspec that have a syntax error or otherwise blow up bad enough
  that we do not even attempt to run them.  Most of these should have a
  counterpart in localspec that has the offending bits removed.

localspec
  A directory that holds the Gemstone fixes for rubyspecs that cause MagLev
  to choke.
  NOTE: to get specs to run from this directory, you need to change the
  require and load statements in the files

  FROM:
      require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../spec_helper'
  TO:
      require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../rubyspec/language/' + '/../spec_helper'
