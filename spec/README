* Notes on RSpec and MSpec usage with MagLev

  This directory contains all of the spec related files.

** NEW
   + Add MagLev guards

** OLD

*** do_not_run_specs

    A file read by default.mspec and Don's test files that list the specs
    under rubyspec that have a syntax error or otherwise blow up bad enough
    that we do not even attempt to run them.  Most of these should have a
    counterpart in localspec that has the offending bits removed.

*** localspec
    A directory that holds the Gemstone fixes for rubyspecs that cause
    MagLev to choke.

    NOTE: to get specs to run from this directory, you need to change the
    require and load statements in the files

    FROM:
        require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../spec_helper'
    TO:
        require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../rubyspec/language/' + '/../spec_helper'

*** mspec
    A git submodule that tracks the mspec framework.
    As of 2009-06-28, this is at version 1.5.12 of mspec.
    git://github.com/rubyspec/mspec

    To update to a new version of the mspec and rubyspec submodules, first
    save any edits to the submodule by renaming directories or using git
    stash, etc. Then in top of git checkout (i.e. in parent of this
    directory) do this:
      $ git submodule update --init

*** rubyspec
    A git submodule that tracks the rubyspecs.
    As of 2009-06-28, this was the HEAD from the rubyspec git repository.
    git://github.com/rubyspec/rubyspec

    In order to work around parser problems that cannot be resolved by tagging,
    we've temporarily removed or altered the following files:

      rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/fiber/resume_spec.rb
      rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/fiber/transfer_spec.rb
      rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/kernel/__callee__spec.rb
      rm -f spec/rubyspec/core/kernel/__method__spec.rb

      cp spec/localspec/core/module/autoload_spec.rb \
         spec/rubyspec/core/module/autoload_spec.rb
      cp spec/localspec/language/super_spec.rb \
         spec/rubyspec/language/super_spec.rb

*** tags

    The Gemstone rubyspec tags.  These are maintained in the git
    repository.  To get a complete run of passing specs using tags:
      cd $MAGLEV_HOME
      spec/mspec/bin/mspec -G fails -G breaks -G crashes -G hangs \
        spec/rubyspec/language/ spec/rubyspec/core spec/rubyspec/library/stringio/
