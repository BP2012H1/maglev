fails:Array#[]= sets elements in the range arguments when passed ranges
fails:Array#[]= inserts the given elements with [range] which the range is zero-width
fails:Array#[]= inserts the given elements with [start, length] which length is zero

fails:Array#[]= does nothing if the section defined by range has negative width and the rhs is an empty array
fails:Array#[]= tries to convert Range elements to Integers using #to_int with [m..n] and [m...n]
fails:Array#[]= checks whether the Range elements respond to #to_int with [m..n] and [m...n]

fails:Array#[]= does not call to_ary on rhs array subclasses for multi-element sets
fails:Array#[]= with [index, count] replaces the section to other even if cnt spanning beyond the array boundary
fails:Array#[]= with [index, count] pads the Array with nils if the span is past the end
fails:Array#[]= with [index, count] raises an IndexError when passed start and negative length
fails:Array#[]= with [m..n] replaces the section defined by range
fails:Array#[]= with [m..n] replaces the section if m < 0 and n > 0
fails:Array#[]= with [m..n] inserts the other section at m if m > n
fails:Array#[] after a shift works for insertion
