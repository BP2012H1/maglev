fails:Hash#== computes equality for complex recursive hashes
fails:Hash#== returns true iff other Hash has the same number of keys and each key-value pair matches
fails:Hash#== returns true if other Hash has the same number of keys and each key-value pair matches, even though the default-value are not same
