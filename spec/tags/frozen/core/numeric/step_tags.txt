fails:Numeric#step with [stop, step] increments self (using #+) until self > stop when step > 0
fails:Numeric#step with [stop, step] decrements self (using #-) until self < stop when step < 0
fails:Numeric#step with [stop, step] when self, stop or step is a Float yields only Floats
fails:Numeric#step with [stop, +step] when self, stop or step is a Float yields while increasing self by step until stop is reached
fails:Numeric#step with [stop, +step] when self, stop or step is a Float yields once when self equals stop
fails:Numeric#step with [stop, +step] when self, stop or step is a Float does not yield when self is greater than stop
