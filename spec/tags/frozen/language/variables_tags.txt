fails:Basic assignment assigns nil to lhs when rhs is an empty expression
fails:Basic assignment allows the assignment of the rhs to the lhs using the rhs splat operator
fails:Basic assignment allows the assignment of the rhs to the lhs using the lhs splat operator
fails:Basic assignment allows the assignment of rhs to the lhs using the lhs and rhs splat operators simultaneously
fails:Assignment using expansion succeeds without conversion
fails:Assigning multiple values allows parallel assignment
fails:Assigning multiple values bundles remaining values to an array when using the splat operator
fails:Assigning multiple values calls #to_ary on rhs arg if rhs has only a single arg
fails:Assigning multiple values allows complex parallel assignment
fails:Operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' is equivalent to 'obj.meth = obj.meth op expr'
fails:Operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' evaluates lhs one time
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' returns result of rhs not result of []=
fails:Multiple assignments with splats * on the lhs collects all parameters from its position onwards as an Array or an empty Array
