== Current state of various applications

This document summarizes the state of various applications under MagLev.
MagLev does not currently support the Ruby C-extension mechanism.  Features
of applications that depend on a C-extension do not work.

=== Rack

Version 0.9.1 of Rack is in <tt>src/external/Rack</tt>

MagLev does not currently support (at least) the following Rack features:
* openid
* mongrel
* memcache
* thin
* showexceptions (depends on erb)
* showstatus (depends on erb)
* cookies (depends on openssl)
* fastcgi

=== Sinatra

Version 0.9.0.4 of Sinatra is in <tt>src/external/Sinatra</tt>.   Much of
Sinatra runs, but some things don't.

The following items seem to work (at least in the simple case)
* Routes
* Source code reloading
* Views (erb)

The following items are known not to work:

* Cookies and Cookie based sessions
  WEBrick requires openssl for cookie support. openssl is a C-based
  library, and MagLev does not yet support ruby c-extensions.

==== GemStone Patches

GemStone has made the following modifications to the stock version of
Sinatra:

* lib/sinatra/main.rb: Stubbed out the definition of run.  The
  implementation depended on examining the stack frames returnd by
  Kernel#caller, but the details of filenames caused problems (MagLev
  prints only full pathnames, while MRI prints a variety of formats).

=== RubyGems

A (currently) unpatched version of RubyGems is in the source tree under
src/external/rubygems-1.3.1.  MagLev will run the setup.rb file, as long as
you don't try to make the rdoc:

    $ cd src/external/rubygems-1.3.1
    $ mruby setup.rb --no-rdoc --no-ri

This will create the ruby gems hierarchy under lib/maglev/gems/... and will
create a bin/maglev-gem.  To clean up, there is a rake task:

    $ rake dev:clean-gems

Since bin/maglev-ruby is a shell script, and bin/maglev-gem is also a shell
script, there is a bit of confusion trying to invoke ruby gems the normal
way:

    $ maglev-gem --version
    /Users/pmclain/DevelopmentMagLev/git/bin/maglev-gem: line 8: require: command not found
    /Users/pmclain/DevelopmentMagLev/git/bin/maglev-gem: line 9: require: command not found
    ...

This is because the shell ends up trying to read the commands in
bin/maglev-gem as shell commands...

If you run maglev, and pass maglev-gem as the script, then you can invoke
some of the ruby gems commands:

    $ maglev-ruby bin/maglev-gem --version
    1.3.1

But most of the interesting commands do not yet work (list, install,...).
We're working on it, but it is not currently our highest priority.
