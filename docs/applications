== Current state of various applications

This document summarizes the state of various applications under MagLev.
MagLev does not currently support the Ruby C extension mechanism.  Features
of applications that depend on a C extension do not work.

=== Rack

MagLev does not currently support (at least) the following Rack features:
* openid
* mongrel
* memcache
* thin
* showexceptions (depends on erb)
* showstatus (depends on erb)
* cookies (depends on openssl)
* fastcgi

=== Sinatra

Much of Sinatra runs, but some things don't.

The following items seem to work (at least in the simple case)
* Routes
* Source code reloading
* Views (erb)

The following items are known not to work:

* Cookies and Cookie based sessions
  WEBrick requires openssl for cookie support. openssl is a C based
  library, and MagLev does not yet support Ruby C extensions.

=== RubyGems

A slightly modified rubygems is preinstalled as "maglev-gem". the source 
is in src/external/rubygems-1.3.5.  

It's likely that many gems will not work, especially those requiring C extensions.
However, "maglev-gem install sinatra" will install rack-1.0.0 and sinatra-0.9.4.

To clean up after experimenting with gems, there is a rake task:

    $ rake dev:clean-gems

which removes all traces of any gems you've installed.

==== Gemstone Patches for RubyGems

GemStone has made the following modifications to the stock version of
RubyGems 1.3.5:

* lib/rubygems/package/tar_input.rb:

  The tar support throws away the gzip header before passing the archive to
  zlib.  MagLev's zlib support expects the gzip header (and, apparently, so
  does Rubinius).  This patch has been submitted and accepted by the
  RubyGems project, so we expect rubygems-1.3.6 to install w/o patches to
  the code.
