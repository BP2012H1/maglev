== Current state of various applications

This document summarizes the state of various applications under MagLev.
MagLev does not currently support the Ruby C extension mechanism.  Features
of applications that depend on a C extension do not work.

=== Rack

MagLev does not currently support (at least) the following Rack features:
* openid
* mongrel
* memcache
* thin
* cookies (depends on openssl)
* fastcgi

=== Sinatra

Much of Sinatra runs, but some things don't.

The following items seem to work (at least in the simple case)
* Routes
* Source code reloading
* Views (erb)

The following items are known not to work:

* Cookies and Cookie based sessions
  WEBrick requires openssl for cookie support. openssl is a C based
  library, and MagLev does not yet support Ruby C extensions.

=== RubyGems

RubyGems 1.3.7 is preinstalled as "maglev-gem".

It's likely that many gems will not work, especially those requiring C extensions.
However, "maglev-gem install sinatra" will install rack-1.1.0 and sinatra-1.0.

To clean up after experimenting with gems, there is a rake task:

    $ rake dev:clean-gems

which removes all traces of any gems you've installed.
