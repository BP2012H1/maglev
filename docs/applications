== Current state of various applications

This document summarizes the state of various applications under MagLev.
MagLev does not currently support the Ruby C-extension mechanism.  Features
of applications that depend on a C-extension do not work.

=== Rack

Version 0.9.1 of Rack is in <tt>src/external/Rack</tt>

MagLev does not currently support (at least) the following Rack features:
* openid
* mongrel
* memcache
* thin
* showexceptions (depends on erb)
* showstatus (depends on erb)
* cookies (depends on openssl)
* fastcgi

=== Sinatra

Version 0.9.0.4 of Sinatra is in <tt>src/external/Sinatra</tt>.   Much of
Sinatra runs, but some things don't.

The following items seem to work (at least in the simple case)
* Routes
* Source code reloading
* Views (erb)

The following items are known not to work:

* Cookies and Cookie based sessions
  WEBrick requires openssl for cookie support. openssl is a C-based
  library, and MagLev does not yet support ruby c-extensions.

==== GemStone Patches

GemStone has made the following modifications to the stock version of
Sinatra:

* lib/sinatra/main.rb: Stubbed out the definition of run.  The
  implementation depended on examining the stack frames returnd by
  Kernel#caller, but the details of filenames caused problems (MagLev
  prints only full pathnames, while MRI prints a variety of formats).

* lib/sinatra/base.rb: https://magtrac.gemstone.com/ticket/376
  Work around problem between blocks vs. procs.

=== RubyGems

Version 1.3.1 of RubyGems is in <tt>src/external/rubygems-1.3.1</tt>.  The
RubyGems setup script runs, but currently rdoc and ri are broken.  To run
the setup script:

    $ src/external/rubygems-1.3.1
    $ maglev-ruby setup.rb --no-rdoc --no-ri

This will install the RubyGems libraries under
<tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/lib/ruby/site_ruby</tt> and will create
<tt>bin/maglev-gem</tt>.

To uninstall the files, run:

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
    $ rake dev:clean-gems
