= GitHub

Here's how the MagLev team uses GitHub:

+ The master branch holds mainline development.  It should always be in a
  runnable state.  Only merge into master from topic branches.
+ Do most work on topic branches; then do a pull request to merge into
  master.  Using pull requests allows others on the team a chance to look
  at the changes, or simply be informed of the change.
+ Try and get some other core member to review and close the pull request.
+ Push topic branches to github (enables backup, collaboration and
  visibility of what's going on).
+ Releases are on a release branch (1.0, 1.1, 2.0 etc.); cherry-pick from
  master to release.
+ If your commit fixes an issue on the github issue tracker, then include
  "fixes #nnn" in the commit message.  This will allow github to correlate
  the commit and the issue.
