=== Required prerequisites

You must be running on a suitable machine and OS. The install or
upgrade script you used to download MagLev should have complained if
your machine was not suitable.
 
Some prerequisites must be installed on your machine before MagLev can
run correctly.

You will need the following MRI Ruby resources on your machine:

1. MRI Ruby 1.8.6 (other versions are not supported)
   Patchlevel 287 is required, patchlevel 111 and 114 currently don't work
2. Ruby Gems
3. ParseTree gem (version 3.0.3 or later)
4. Rake

You can check which ParseTree version you have installed with:
   gem list --local 
If you don't have ParseTree or have an earlier version:
   sudo gem install ParseTree

=== Optional prerequisites

If you have rlwrap (a GNU readline wrapper) installed on your machine,
you will be able to do keyboard editing of input to maglev-irb and to Topaz
while debugging. On Linux, if you do not have rlwrap installed, you will see
warnings about its absence when entering Topaz or maglev-irb.
