=== Required prerequisites

You must be running on a suitable machine and OS. The install or
upgrade script you used to download MagLev should have complained if
your machine was not suitable.
 
Some prerequisites must be installed on your machine before MagLev can
run correctly.

You will need the following MRI Ruby resources on your machine:

1. MRI Ruby 1.8.6 (other versions are not supported)
2. Ruby Gems
3. ParseTree gem version 2.2.0 (version 3.x will not work).
4. Rake

For Linux users without ruby experience, you need to install 
  ruby v1.8.6
  rubygems
with your Linux package manager or installer.
Then with a live Internet connection, install ruby gems in this order:
  /usr/bin/gem install RubyInline -v 3.6.0
  /usr/bin/gem install rubyforge -v 1.0.0
  /usr/bin/gem install rake -v 0.8.1
  /usr/bin/gem install hoe -v 1.5.3
  /usr/bin/gem install ParseTree -v 2.2.0

=== Optional prerequisites

If you have rlwrap (a GNU readline wrapper) installed on your machine,
you will be able to do keyboard editing of input to maglev-irb and to Topaz
while debugging. On Linux, if you do not have rlwrap installed, you will see
warnings about its absence when entering Topaz or maglev-irb.
