=== Required prerequisites

You must be running on a suitable machine and 64-bit OS. The install or
upgrade script you used to download MagLev should have complained if
your machine was not suitable.
 
=== Optional prerequisites

If you have rlwrap (a GNU readline wrapper) installed on your machine,
you will be able to do keyboard editing of input to maglev-irb and to Topaz
while debugging. On Linux, if you do not have rlwrap installed, you will see
warnings about its absence when entering Topaz or maglev-irb.
