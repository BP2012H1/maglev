== <tt>maglev-irb</tt>: Open an interactive MagLev shell

=== Synopsis

MagLev now includes a slightly modified copy of irb called maglev-irb. <b>This documentation applies to the deprecated maglev-irb version, temporarily renamed topaz-irb.</b> We'll update the docs soon.

MagLev provides an IRB-like utility, <tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/bin/maglev-irb</tt>.
It provides a minimal interactive environment, but is neither robust nor a
full irb implementation. GemStone plans to offer a full implementation of 
ruby IRB in a future release.

  Usage: maglev-irb [options]
  OPTIONS:
     -d      Run in debugging mode
     -G      Use /opt/gemstone instead of MAGLEV_HOME for locks and logs
     -h      Show help message
     -v      Print version number

[+STOP+]            Clear the input buffer.
