== RubySpecs and MagLev

We've included a copy of the MSpec framework (<tt>spec/mspec</tt>, version
1.5.6) and the RubySpecs (<tt>spec/rubyspec</tt>, latest as of
2009-01-22). You may be able to run with later MSpec or RubySpec versions,
but this is the version we used when we built the system.

=== Files

All of the spec related files are under <tt>$MAGLEV_HOME/spec</tt>, except the
<tt>default.mspec</tt> and <tt>passing.mspec</tt> config files which liver
in the +$MAGLEV_HOME+ directory.


[<tt>do_not_run_specs</tt>]
  A file read by <tt>default.mspec</tt> that list the specs under
  <tt>rubyspec</tt> that have a syntax error or otherwise prevent any of
  the expectations in that file from running.  Most of the files listed
  here have a counterpart in <tt>localspec</tt> that has the offending bits
  removed.

[<tt>localspec/</tt>]
  A directory that holds the Gemstone fixes for rubyspecs that cause MagLev
  to choke.

[<tt>mspec/</tt>]
  A git submodule that tracks the mspec framework.
  As of 2009-01-22, this is at version 1.5.6 of mspec.
  http://github.com/rubyspec/mspec

[<tt>rubyspec/</tt>]
  A git submodule that tracks the rubyspecs.
  As of 2009-01-22, this was the HEAD from the rubyspec git repository.
  http://github.com/rubyspec/rubyspec

[<tt>tags/</tt>]
  The Gemstone rubyspec tags.  These are maintained in the git repository.

=== Run MSpec with +rake+

There are several rake tasks that help with the specs.  The most important
are:

    $ rake -T spec
    rake spec:ci          # Run the continuous integration specs (was passingpsecs) on MagLev
    rake spec:debugci     # Run the continuous integration specs on MagLev with debug
    rake spec:mri         # Run the continuous integration specs against MRI

=== Run MSpec manually

Assuming <tt>maglev-ruby</tt> is on your +PATH+, you can run specs like
this:

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
    $ spec/mspec/bin/mspec -t maglev-ruby spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/nil

To run with debug mode on (so that you end up in the topaz prompt on an
error):

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
    $ spec/mspec/bin/mspec -t maglev-ruby -T -d spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/nil

=== Tag Failing Specs

MSpec allows you to place arbitrary tags on expectations.  The tags are
kept in a separate directory hierarchy outside of the rubyspec dir.  For
the MagLev development environment, the hierarchy is kept in
<tt>spec/tags/frozen</tt>, and is checked into Git.  The tag files are
named according to the <tt>:tags_patterns</tt> configuration parameter in
<tt>default.mspec</tt> at the top level git directory:

    # The set of substitutions to transform a spec filename into a tag
    # filename.  The transformations are applied, in the given sequence, to
    # a filename, yielding a tag file name.
    set :tags_patterns, [
      [%r(spec/rubyspec/), 'spec/frozen/'],
      [%r(spec/), 'spec/tags/'],
      [/_spec.rb$/, '_tags.txt']
    ]

The MagLev scheme puts the tags for a given spec into a parallel directory
hierarchy under <tt>spec/tags/frozen</tt>.  So, the tags for
<tt>spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/array/at_spec.rb</tt> are in
<tt>spec/tags/frozen/1.8/core/array/at_tags.txt</tt>.

The mspec-tag command will run tests and then tag them based on the results
of running the tests.

default action::  add a tag   What action to take when triggered
default tag::     "fails"     The default tag to work on
default outcome:: <tt>:fail</tt>       The spec outcome that triggers the tag action

Together, the above defaults say "when the test outcome is :fail, then add
a tag named "fails" for that expectation.

==== Tag Examples

Note: we don't need to specify <tt>-n maglev-ruby</tt> or <tt>-t
maglev-ruby</tt>, since the <tt>defaults.mspec</tt> file has that configured.

===== Tag all failing specs

To tag failing specs, you can do something like the following, which tags
all the failing Array specs:

    $ spec/mspec/bin/mspec tag spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/array/

But suppose there are already some failures recorded, especially for some
nasty bugs that prevent mspec from continuing.  Then you can also add
<tt>-G fails</tt> so that the tagging run won't run specs that are already
known to fail, i.e., it will add to the known failures in a "safe" manner:

    $ spec/mspec/bin/mspec tag -G fails spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/array/

===== Run specs, ignoring any tagged as fails

The <tt>-G tag</tt> option means: Exclude examples with descriptions tagged
with <tt>tag</tt>:

    $ spec/mspec/bin/mspec -G fails spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/array/

===== Run specs, untagging fixed expectations

If you've made some code changes to MagLev, and expect some previously
failing specs to now pass, you can re-run the failing specs and have mspec
un-tag the ones that now pass:

    # delete the fails tag if the spec now runs
    $ spec/mspec/bin/mspec tag --del fails spec/ruby/1.8/core/array/append_spec.rb

===== Tag arbitrary specs

The following will tag all the specs in <tt>select_spec.rb</tt> with the
+fails+ tag:

    $ spec/mspec/bin/mspec tag --add fails -L spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/array/select_spec.rb

The <tt>-L</tt> says to "do the action" (in this case, tag) to all the
specs that match (i.e. all expectations in <tt>select_spec.rb</tt>).
