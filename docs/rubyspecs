== RubySpecs and MagLev

There are git submodules for the +mspec+ framework (<tt>spec/mspec</tt>,
version 1.5.3) and the RubySpecs (<tt>spec/rubyspec</tt>, latest as of
2008-12-04).

=== Run mspecs with +rake+

There are three rake tasks that help with the specs:

    $ rake -T spec
    rake spec:ci          # Run the continuous integration specs (was passingpsecs) on MagLev
    rake spec:debugci     # Run the continuous integration specs on MagLev with debug
    rake spec:mri         # Run the continuous integration specs against MRI

=== Run mspecs manually

Assuming <tt>maglev-ruby</tt> is on your +PATH+, you can specs like this:

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
    $ spec/bin/mspec -t maglev-ruby spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/nil

To run with debug mode on (so that you end up in the topaz prompt on an
error):

    $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
    $ spec/bin/mspec -t maglev-ruby -T -d spec/rubyspec/1.8/core/nil
