== Release Notes for the MagLev Alpha release of August 24, 2009

=== Persistence support

See the {Persistence API}[link:files/docs/persistence-api.html]

=== Special methods
* Underscore + camelCase = GemStone unmodifiable code.  There are several
  methods that begin with an underscore and are camelCase,
  e.g. <tt>_isArray</tt>.  MagLev will not allow you to re-define these
  methods.
* <tt>equal?</tt> is also a special case, and you are unable to re-define
  it.

=== <tt>maglev-irb</tt>

* <tt>maglev-irb</tt> is not +irb+.  Eventually, <tt>maglev-irb</tt> will
  be +irb+, but not yet.

=== Kernel
* Note that we don't support instance variables as block arguments,
  <tt>{ |@cc| }</tt> must be coded as <tt>{ | c | @cc = c }</tt>.
* <tt>Kernel#autoload</tt> is a stub.  It does an immediate require of the
  file.
* <tt>Kernel#autoload?</tt> is a stub.  It always returns nil.
* <tt>Kernel#require</tt>: Tilde expansion is done only on <tt>~/...</tt>,
  not on <tt>~user/...</tt>, <tt>$"</tt> is not updated

=== Threads
* <tt>ThreadGroup</tt> is a stub.

=== Noise from rlwrap
* In some cases, <tt>rlwrap</tt> (see Prerequisites[link:files/docs/prerequisites.html]) will output noise while typing at a Topaz prompt (Linux only).

=== Misc
* +ARGF+ is not supported.
* Continuations are not supported.
* +ObjectSpace+ is not supported.
* <tt>Object.equal?</tt> may not be overridden.  For performance reasons,
  it is a special selector.
* String#unpack and Array#pack do not support pointers ('p' and 'P').
