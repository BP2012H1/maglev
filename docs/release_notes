== Release Notes for the MagLev Alpha release of December 19, 2008.

=== Persistence support

The Gemstone class has methods for +commitTransaction+, +abortTransaction+
and +beginTransaction+. In the future, this functionality is likely to be 
provided by different classes and messages

=== <tt>maglev-irb</tt>

* <tt>maglev-irb</tt> is not +irb+.  Eventually, <tt>maglev-irb</tt> will
  be +irb+, but not yet.

=== Kernel
* <tt>Kernel#autoload</tt> is a stub.  It does an immediate require of the
  file.
* <tt>Kernel#autoload?</tt> is a stub.  It always returns nil.
* <tt>Kernel#require</tt>: Tilde expansion is done only on <tt>~/...</tt>,
  not on <tt>~user/...</tt>, <tt>$"</tt> is not updated

=== Threads
* <tt>ThreadGroup</tt> is a stub.

=== Noise from rlwrap
* In some cases, <tt>rlwrap</tt> (see Prerequisites[link:files/docs/prerequisites])
will output noise while typing at a Topaz prompt.
 
=== Misc
* +ARGF+ is not supported.
* Continuations are not supported.
* +ObjectSpace+ is not supported.
* <tt>Object.equal?</tt> may not be overridden.  For performance reasons,
  it is a special selector.
