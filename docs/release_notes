== Release Notes for the MagLev Alpha release of December 19, 2008.

=== Persistence support

The Gemstone class has methods for +commitTransaction+, +abortTransaction+
and +beginTransaction+. In the future, this functionality is likely to be
provided by different classes and messages

=== Special methods
* Underscore + camelCase = GemStone unmodifiable code.  There are several
  methods that begin with an underscore and are camelCase,
  e.g.,<tt>_isArray</tt>.  MagLev will not allow you to re-define these
  methods.
* <tt>equal?</tt> is also a special case, and you are unable to re-define
  it.

=== <tt>maglev-irb</tt>

* <tt>maglev-irb</tt> is not +irb+.  Eventually, <tt>maglev-irb</tt> will
  be +irb+, but not yet.

=== Kernel
* <tt>Kernel#autoload</tt> is a stub.  It does an immediate require of the
  file.
* <tt>Kernel#autoload?</tt> is a stub.  It always returns nil.
* <tt>Kernel#require</tt>: Tilde expansion is done only on <tt>~/...</tt>,
  not on <tt>~user/...</tt>, <tt>$"</tt> is not updated

=== Threads
* <tt>ThreadGroup</tt> is a stub.

=== Noise from rlwrap
* In some cases, <tt>rlwrap</tt> (see Prerequisites[link:files/docs/prerequisites]) will output noise while typing at a Topaz prompt (Linux only).

=== Initial startup
* The first time you run maglev-ruby or maglev-irb after installing MagLev there will be a delay of up to 30 seconds for system initialization.
* If you run maglev-irb immediately after installing MagLev, you may get an "Almost out of Memory" warning and a stack trace (Macintosh only). This can be safely ignored as it does not affect operation of the system.

=== Misc
* +ARGF+ is not supported.
* Continuations are not supported.
* +ObjectSpace+ is not supported.
* <tt>Object.equal?</tt> may not be overridden.  For performance reasons,
  it is a special selector.
