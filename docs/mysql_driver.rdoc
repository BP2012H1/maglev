== MySQL Driver Notes

MagLev includes a copy of
<tt>ruby-mysql</tt>[http://www.tmtm.org/en/ruby/mysql], version 0.2.6 under
<tt>lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8</tt>.  This is the oler, pure-ruby version of the
MySQL driver.

If you use MySQL 5, then you'll need to ensure that any user you login with
has an "old" password scheme.  See
old-client[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/old-client.html]
for details.

See <tt>examples/mysql/</tt> for examples of how to use the driver.
