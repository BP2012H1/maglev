=== MagLev Parse Server not running

If 'maglev status' tells you "MagLev Parse Server is not running on port 2001"
it is most likely a problem running the ParseTree gem. To diagnose:
	export PARSETREE_PORT=2001
	cd $MAGLEV_HOME/bin
	ruby parsetree_parser.rb

If that gives the following error on MacOSX:
	ERROR: Cannot find header dir for ruby
you can resolve the problem by upgrading to the latest Xcode

If you get the error:
  in `getaddrinfo': getnameinfo: ai_family not supported (SocketError)
your ruby 1.8.6 was compiled without ipv6 support. You need to compile ruby with ipv6 support, even if nothing else on your system supports ipv6. On Gentoo Linux, you can do this by adding the line
  dev-lang/ruby   ipv6
to /etc/portage/package.use, then re-emerge dev-lang/ruby.

Also note that you must be using ParseTree 2.2.0; version 3.x will not work with MagLev.
You can check which version you have installed with:
  gem list --local

=== lsof

'maglev status' uses the lsof command to see if the parse server
is running. If you do not have lsof installed, or cannot run it,
uncomment the equivalent netstat command in $MAGLEV_HOME/bin/maglev.
