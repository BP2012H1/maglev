# Apparently, if we bcrypt-ruby appears as a dependency of another gem
# (rails), and that gem is loaded from source-A (rubygems.org), the
# dependency will *also* be loaded from there, even though we've explicitly
# listed bcrypt-ruby to be loaded on its own.  I.e., the following Gemfile
# fails.
#     source 'http://w2-stdev-ub10-01.gemstone.com:9292'
#     source 'http://rubygems.org'
#
#     gem 'bcrypt-ruby'
#     gem 'rails', '~>3.1'
#
source 'http://w2-stdev-ub10-01.gemstone.com:9292'
gem 'bcrypt-ruby'
