== MagLev Test Scripts

This directory contains test cases for some of the MagLev rake tasks,
such as creating/starting/stopping stones, netldi, running topaz, etc.

Run them with 'ruby' not 'maglev-ruby', e.g. 
    ruby topaz_test_case.rb     # should pass
    ruby stone_test_case.rb     # currently fails two backup tests

They depend on the 'flexmock' gem.

There is also a shell script that starts/stops/restarts a server called "aaa"
It's used to make sure the rake scripts do the right thing. It will be
replaced by a proper tests script soon. Read the script "testRakelib.sh"
before running it with "bash -v"
