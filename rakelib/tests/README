== MagLev Test Scripts

This directory contains test cases for some of the MagLev rake tasks,
such as creating/starting/stopping stones, netldi, running topaz, etc.

Run them with 'ruby' not 'maglev-ruby', e.g. 
    ruby topaz_test_case.rb     # should pass
    ruby stone_test_case.rb     # should pass

They depend on the 'flexmock' gem.

There is also a shell script that starts/stops/restarts a server called
"test.rakelib". It's used to make sure the rake scripts do the right thing.
It will be replaced by a proper test script one of these days. For now,
run it with 'bash -v testRakelib.sh' and eyeball the results.
